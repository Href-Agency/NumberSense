                        The MathsSense Mathematics Programme consists of video lessons with 
                        exercises for each lesson.The video lessons are supplied on a USB drive with 
                        the exercises and solutions available in hard copy. An online digital version 
                        of the programme is also available.
                        <br><br>
                        The MathsSense Mathematics Programme has been developed as a 
                        foundational high school mathematics course. It is well aligned with the 
                        South African mathematics curriculum with respect to content and content 
                        progression.

                        Reasoning is at the heart of solving problems

                        The MathsSense Mathematics Programme has been created to support learners, development of a deep understanding of mathematics. The focus of the programme and the approach adopted in the materials is on developing mathematical knowledge with understanding so that that learners can apply their knowledge with confidence in unfamiliar situationsand across different mathematical topics.
                        <br><br>
                        Throughout the programme, the underlying objective is to support learners to develop reasoning skills. Reasoning skills are foundational to learning and doing mathematics. More generally, reasoning skills are important for creating, learning and using knowledge. As a critical life skill, reasoning involves generating claims or evaluating claims based on the available verifiable data and facts. It involves not taking one’s own or others’ assumptions, contentions or feelingsat face value. It also involves recognising inconsistencies and errors in arguments. 
                        <br><br>
                        The ability to reason affects the ability to learn from new information and experiences since reasoning determines how one does or does not comprehend, evaluate and acceptclaims and arguments.
